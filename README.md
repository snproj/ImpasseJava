# ImpasseJava
Unfinished 1d board game of my own design.

## Usage
Compile with any build tool with `FirstClass.java` as the main class. The game is text based. I can't remember the rules by now, but essentially it's two sides trying to push each other back on a 1-dimensional playing field (hence the name).

## Purpose
Although I got into OOP early on in my exploration of programming, I had never actually touched Java until a fair ways in. I had always heard of Java as *the* OOP language, but was a bit bored by its corporate reputation and the weird JVM.

A bit ironic, considering that studying enterprise programming practices is currently something that interests me from a linguistic and design point of view.

So I made this based on a game idea I had, and never really finished it since at some point I felt I had gotten a basic grasp of the language itself, which wasn't so different from what I had seen in other languages. It was about now that I was realizing that the evolution of mainstream programming languages tended to drive them to be more mutually intelligible than human ones!
